        "LLM models like Gemini are automating tedious tasks like data entry without any complex training. I discovered that I could simply show the model a receipt and ask it for the total price in plain English, and it understood the layout almost like a human would. However, I also realized that while the AI is smart, it isn't always perfectly precise with formatting; I still needed to write clear prompts and use a bit of code to clean up the numbers (like removing currency symbols) to make the data usable. Finally, by comparing the AI's guesses against the actual answers, I saw the value of objectively measuring performance, which gave me the confidence that this technology is reliable enough to handle real-world financial documents."
