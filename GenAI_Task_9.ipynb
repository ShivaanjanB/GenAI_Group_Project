        "Through these tasks, I learned that different problems require very specific prompting strategies to get accurate results. In Task 7, I saw firsthand how using specific Personas such as a Skeptic could pierce through corporate gloss and reveal hidden biases in financial reports that a neutral prompt might accept as fact. In Task 8, I realized that generic prompts often fail to distinguish between complex business models. It was only by applying Structured Constraints via the Atom of Thought technique that I could isolate the unique structural risks of Block compared to PayPal. Finally, Task 9 taught me the most important rule of all which is that LLMs cannot be trusted with calendar math. For any task involving precise calculations or dates, I must use Code Execution tools to ensure the output is reliable rather than relying on the model making a guess."
