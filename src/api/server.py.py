"""
FastAPI server to expose the RAG retrieval and index pipeline as a REST API.

This module provides a minimal HTTP wrapper around the existing audit‑trail
retrieval logic implemented in ``src/pipeline/index.py``.  It allows
external clients (such as a Lovable application) to submit search queries
and receive structured results with citations and scoring.  Results are
filtered according to the configured ``as_of_date`` and can be further
filtered by source name or tags.  In addition, an optional reliability
ranking is applied when multiple sources are configured with differing
trust levels.

The API defines a single endpoint ``POST /query`` which accepts a JSON
payload with the query text and optional parameters:

* ``top_k`` – number of results to return (default 5).
* ``source_names`` – list of source identifiers to restrict retrieval.
* ``tags`` – list of tags to restrict retrieval.

The response is a JSON object containing the top‑k results with fields
matching those returned by ``query_index``.  If a source has a
``reliability`` value specified in the configuration, the raw score is
multiplied by this weight before ranking.

To run the server locally:

```
uvicorn src.api.server:app --reload
```

Note: Running the server requires ``fastapi`` and ``uvicorn`` in your
Python environment.  These dependencies are intentionally optional and
should be added to ``requirements.txt`` if you intend to deploy the API.
